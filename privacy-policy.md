## Disclosing information outside Australia

If information is stored or processed overseas, for example, in an offshore data centre, this can count as an overseas disclosure and you should mention it here. 

### When overseas disclosure occurs

Provider may disclose personal information to organisations outside of Australia such as, {{overseas organisations}} located in {{disclosure countries}}.  By using the Services, Individuals consent to the disclosure of their Personal Information to overseas recipients.

Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that overseas recipients deal with Personal Information in a way that is consistent with the principles of the Privacy Act, but Individuals will not have the same rights in relation to overseas recipients who handle their information as they would with Australian recipients.

## Privacy contact

There needs to be a way for Individuals to get in touch with the Provider about privacy issues (including complaints).  Small organizations can use their public contact details for fielding privacy complaints.

Larger organisations may wish to nominate a privacy officer to deal with privacy related complaints. A privacy officer is an individual within your organisation that is responsible for dealing with privacy issues.

It is important to set reasonable time frames for dealing with complaints or questions. 2 weeks is a reasonable response time. A month is a good amount of time for resolving issues.

### Privacy complaints and questions go to the Provider's general contact details.

Questions or complaints from Individuals relating to Provider's dealings with Personal Information should be directed to Provider on {{contact details}}.

When an Individual communicates a complaint to Provider, Provider will respond within {{response time}}, and seek to resolve the complaint entirely within {{resolution time}} if the nature of the complaint permits it.

Provider will make a reasonable effort to resolve the complaints or questions of Individuals, and where Provider is unable to do so, Provider will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

If an Individual considers that a matter remains unresolved, Individual may contact the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) (http://oaic.gov.au).

### Privacy complaints and questions go to the Provider's privacy officer.

Questions or complaints from Individuals relating to Provider's use of Personal Information should be directed to Provider's privacy officer. Provider's privacy officer is {{privacy officer}}, contactable on {{contact details}}.

When an Individual communicates a complaint to Provider, Provider will respond within {{response time}}, and seek to resolve the complaint entirely within {{resolution time}} if the nature of the complaint permits it.

Provider's privacy officer will make a reasonable effort to address complaints or questions of Individuals, and where the privacy officer is unable to do so, the privacy officer will attempt to explain why it is unable to do so.

## Accessing information

Under privacy law, Individuals have the right to contact the Provider to modify or obtain information held about them by the Provider.

## Unknowingly collected information

It's possible that Provider ends up collecting certain Personal Information without being aware of it. For example, if your organisation is a data backup service, Organisations may use the Service to back up the information of Individuals that the Organisation collects at first instance.

It's a good idea to explain to people that you're aware of the possibility, and are making a good faith effort to handle it.

### Personal Information that Provider collects unknowingly.

Provider acknowledges that from time to time, Provider may come into possession of Personal Information without being aware of it, for example, from other organisations using Provider's service to store data.

Provider will make a good faith effort to deal with such Personal Information in accordance with this privacy policy and the principles in the Privacy Act.

## Disclosures during use of the services

Individuals might disclose their Personal Information to Organisations while using the Services. For example, an Individual may process a payment through the Service and in doing so, share credit card details with a payment processor.

### Using the Services to disclose Personal Information to other organisations

During the use of the Services, Individuals may disclose Personal Information to Organisations. Provider will make a good faith effort to ensure that such disclosures are clear to Individuals, but how those Organisations handle Personal Information is beyond the control of Provider.
